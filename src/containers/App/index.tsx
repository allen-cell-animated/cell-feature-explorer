                                        The Cell Feature Explorer is an online tool to access our
                                        complete database of segmented and processed cells as curated
                                        datasets. We have annotated each of our cells with measured
                                        features, such as cellular volume and what stage of mitosis it
                                        is in. The tool is composed of a plot and a 3D viewer. In the
                                        plot each cell is graphed by its measured features or select
                                        principal components described in our journal publications. To

                                    <p>hiPS cells from the Allen Cell Collection grow in
                                    epithelial-like monolayer colonies when cultured on glass using
                                    our methods. We image rectangular fields of view (FOV) from
                                    these colonies in 3D using spinning disk confocal microscopy to
                                    collect 4 channels of data for each FOV, including one
                                    brightfield channel and three fluorescent channels for: dyed
                                    DNA, dyed cell membrane, and one fluorescently labeled proteinâ€“
                                    designed to visualize a particular organelle or structure via
                                    endogenous tagging. The fluorescent channels are segmented to
                                    demarcate the structures from the background noise and to define
                                    the boundaries of individual cells. The segmented structures are
                                    then measured, and the data for these measurements, as well as
                                    shape modes (from principal component analysis) are made
                                    available for plotting at the top of the CFE tool page. The
                                    beautiful cells and the FOVs from which they were segmented can
                                    be explored in a 3D viewer at the bottom of the CFE tool page.
