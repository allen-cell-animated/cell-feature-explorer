### Deployment

#### Staging deployment
Automatically builds from `main`, can also be manually triggered on github actions. 
Optional input for pointing the staging build at the non production database. But will 
default to the production database on automatic builds. 

#### Production deployment
On `main` branch
1. Make a new version: `npm version [patch/minor/major]`
2. Push the new package.json version: `git push origin main`
3. Push the new tag: `git push origin [NEW_TAG]`

This will trigger a github workflow which copies the assets from the staging bucket into the production bucket.
